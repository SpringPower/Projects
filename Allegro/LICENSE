These are precompiled binaries of the Allegro Library and its dependencies, as well as headers for using them.
Allegro and its dependencies (DUMB/libFLAC/FreeType/PhysFS/Theora/Vorbis/etc.) do not belong to me and have their own licenses available online.

mingw32 binaries were not compiled by me but obtained here https://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/613773/995477#target
